# Project Title:  **A periodicity-agnostic method for detecting parasitic botnets in Distributed Hash Table-based Peer-to-Peer networks**

# Project Description:
Parasitic botnets coexist with benign nodes and services in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network.
Recent years have observed the emergence of new parasitic botnets on the BitTorrent and IPFS networks. Their presence is a threat
to benign nodes and services relying upon the underlying DHT. State-of-the-art in detecting parasitic botnets are rather limited in their application
scenarios and can be easily circumvented. Parasitic botnets are harmful to the DHT network in many ways. They can manipulate
consensus algorithms or sabotage the networks' underlying routing mechanisms for profit and fun. Hence, the main objective of this research is
to propose a more effective method to detect parasitic botnets within DHT-based P2P networks.
